## Computational Musicology Portfolio

A few years ago, I decided to create a new Spotify playlist each month in order to capture my favorite music at various points in time. To keep each playlist consistent, I gave myself the following three conditions:
1. the playlist would contain exactly 11 songs
2. no two songs in the playlist could have the same artist
3. every song in the playlist had to be a song I had listened to during the given calendar month

Between March 2018 and January 2022, I ended up creating 41 monthly playlists, which I have now combined into a single 451-song playlist.

**I think this playlist could serve as a corpus for my portfolio project because it represents the diversity of my music preferences, reflects month-by-month changes in how I listen to music, and reveals long-term trends for how my taste in music may have changed over a period of four years.**

I think the variable of time can be used to create and compare groups of songs. For example, I can compare the valence of songs I added before the COVID-19 pandemic to those I added during lockdown. I can also investigate how different seasons might affect my listening history -- do I listen to more upbeat music in warmer months, or during the winter in an attempt to boost my mood? How has my appreciation for certain artists and genres changed month-by-month and year-by-year?

Since I almost exclusively listen to music on Spotify, I believe this corpus is highly representative of my personal listening habits. I also think the variation in songs will allow me to analyze certain tracks in greater detail. Songs like "2021" by A.G. Cook (a short, digitally-produced electronic track) will contrast greatly with "Obi Agye Me Dofo" by Vis Ã  Vis (a 10-minute Afrobeat track recorded live in the 1970s). These songs fall on different sides of the spectrum in terms of length, genre, and "acousticness," making them good candidates for investigation.
